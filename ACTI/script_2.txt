You freeze. Eyes half-lidded. Breath shallow.
The orcs shuffle closer. One leans in, snorts. “Crushed ribs. Dead.”
The other shrugs. “Too broken to sell. Leave him.”
Their footsteps fade. Minutes pass. Then — wheels creak.
A cart rolls into view, pulled by a skeletal beast. Figures in plague masks begin tossing corpses onto it like meat.
You’re grabbed. Thrown.
The world rocks around you as the cart lurches into motion, toward a place whispered only in war camps
The Wastelands.
Where nothing comes back.
