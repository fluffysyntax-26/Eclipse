The creature turns.
You watch it move, studying the way its limbs shift, how it leans to one side when it walks — a limp. Weakness.
Your grip tightens. The cube hums, and your instincts ignite.
Bladebind awakens.
The sword glows faintly — not with fire, but with memory. Your memory. Or someone else’s.
You surge from Veilstep’s edge with impossible speed, blade sweeping in a high arc. The creature spins too late — and the moment your sword hits, the world shudders.
The steel bites clean through its neck, slicing mask, sinew, and bone in one fluid strike.
It drops. Instantly.
No scream. No resistance. Just silence.
Then — an eruption.
The creature's body convulses, and a halo of cube aura blasts outward. Ethereal fragments spiral around you, drawn into your cube, absorbed like embers pulled into a furnace.
Your blade dims. Your breath steadies. You look down at the corpse.
“One of the Scattered… no longer.”
