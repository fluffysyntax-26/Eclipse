You surge upward — faster than you expect. The sword moves like an extension of your body.
One orc turns, mouth curling into a growl — too slow. Steel sings through the air, cutting cleanly through his throat.Blood spurts, hot and dark.
The second lunges — your body shifts on instinct, stepping past his swing and driving the blade into his gut. You twist. He falls.
Silence returns. You stand above two fresh corpses, your breath calm... too calm.
Swordplay feels natural. Too natural.
You stand still for a moment.
Panting. Blood dripping from your arms, your chest, the cracked plates of your ruined armor. But your grip on the sword is firm, your hands steady. Too steady. This isn’t just luck. Whoever you were — you were forged in battle.
The cube hums louder, brighter now, as if feeding off the aftermath. You glance at it. For a second, you see something within the glow — not a reflection, but a flicker of... memory?
Your name. So close. But gone again.
Then — movement ahead. Not orcs this time.
A lone figure, cloaked and hooded, steps into view from the treeline. Slim, silent. Watching. They don’t draw a weapon — just raise a hand and point deeper into the forest.
Then vanish.
Your pulse quickens.
The cube pulses in response, its glow pointing the same direction.
