You let it pass… until you don’t.
As it turns its back, your breath steadies again. Your body becomes still as myth.
And then you move.
Veilstep doesn’t fade — it flows. You remain cloaked as your feet barely touch the ground. You reach the creature’s spine.
The cube in your grip pulses — a single, silent nod.
Then you strike.
Your blade plunges into the base of the creature’s neck — right where mask meets flesh. For a heartbeat, nothing happens.
Then everything does.
The creature convulses. A choked, gurgling hiss escapes its broken maw. It collapses in a heap — twitching once… then still.
A blinding shockwave of cube aura explodes from the body, coating the forest floor in pale light. You feel it in your bones. Not just power, but fragments of memory. Of its past. Of yours.
Your cube absorbs it all.
“The cube remembers what you kill,” a voice whispers inside your head.
“And what you become.”
