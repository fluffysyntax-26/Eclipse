You don’t speak. Don’t hesitate.
The forest parts as you move, the cube in your palm throbbing in rhythm with your steps. You follow where the hooded figure pointed — deeper into the dying woods, where the trees lean like mourners and the air hums with ancient tension.
Your boots crunch over shattered bones and scorched leaves. Time feels strange here. Hours or moments — you can’t tell. But the path is clear.
Then… a sound. A whisper, not from around you — inside you.
A voice. Not yours.
“You’ve awakened. Good.”
The cube glows white-hot, then dims. The world flickers — as if you blink, but with your soul.
Suddenly, you’re not in the forest anymore.
You stand in a circle of standing stones, cracked and towering, each one inscribed with runes that shift when you try to read them. The air is still. Too still. And you’re no longer alone.
Across from you stands the figure in the hooded cloak. Closer now, you see their face: half-mask, half-flesh. Not human. Not fully.
Their voice is low and fluid, like water over blades.
“You survived the Cull. That means the cube chose you. Or… what’s left of you.”
You open your mouth — but questions collapse into silence.
“You want answers. But you’re not ready. Not yet.”
“The cube isn’t a weapon. Not only. It’s a key. And a test.”
They raise a hand. The cube in your grip lifts on its own, hovering, spinning slowly between you both.
“Memories… identity… power. All of it is sealed inside. But the locks are scattered across the Wastes.”
The cube flares, projecting flickers of a map — fractured lands, marked with crimson sigils and shattered cities.
“Find the other keys. Survive. And remember who you were.”
A pause. Then the figure steps back, their form already fading into shadow.
“But beware the Ash-King. He remembers you. Even if you don’t.”
The cube drops softly back into your hand — warmer now. Heavier.
Then the stones vanish.
You're back in the forest — or rather, where the forest once stood. Before it was burned to glass.
Smoke curls around you. Something massive is approaching.
