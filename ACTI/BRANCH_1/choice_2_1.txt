You remain motionless.
Not out of cowardice — but clarity. You feel the creature’s strength in your bones, in the air itself. Whatever it is, you are not ready. Not yet.
The thing looms in the clearing for what feels like eternity. Then — without warning — it jerks upright, sniffing the air again. But this time, it lets out a low, croaking chuckle.
“You learn. Unlike the others.”
And with that, it shambles off, back into the blackened trees. Its steps leave no footprints. Just death.
The cube in your hand pulses — slowly, steadily.
You survived. But something tells you this won’t be the last time.
