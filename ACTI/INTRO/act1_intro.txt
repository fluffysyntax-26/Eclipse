Act I
You lie motionless. Your armor is broken, your body bruised. 
In your hand, a ruined sword. In the other, a small glowing cube that pulses softly, almost… alive.
You don’t know your name. You don’t know why you’re here.
But you are not alone.
Heavy footsteps crunch the dirt nearby. Two towering figures stalk the battlefield — orcs, grotesque and scarred, dragging bloodied blades behind them. 
They're checking the bodies.
Killing survivors.
