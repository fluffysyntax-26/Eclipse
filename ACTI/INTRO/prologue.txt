Prologue
Darkness.
Then — the putrid stench of rot.
Your eyes snap open, greeted by a sky smeared in ash and fading embers. You lie flat on your back, half-sunken in blood-soaked soil. 
Around you, the forest groans beneath the weight of silence... and death.
Bodies. Dozens. Hundreds. Some human. Some not. All lifeless.
You try to move. Pain lances through your limbs — but you're alive. Just barely. Your armor is shattered, pieces clinging on like broken memories. 
In your grip, a battered sword — chipped, dented, but still warm.
And then there’s it.
A cube. Small. Glowing. Humming softly in your palm.
You don’t know your name. You don’t know where you are.
But something tells you this... this is not the end.
It’s the beginning.
